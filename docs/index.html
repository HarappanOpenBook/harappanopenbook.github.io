                        <p>Welcome to this open-access textbook covering the Harappan or Indus Valley civilization of ancient South Asia (India). This book aims to provide an authoritative yet accessible introduction to this fascinating Bronze Age culture for undergraduate and advanced high school students as well as general readers.</p>

<h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
<p>The purpose of this textbook is to synthesize current archaeological and anthropological research on Harappan culture into an integrated narrative that is useful and enlightening for students. It will cover topics such as the origins of the civilization, its economic features like agriculture and trade networks, social organization and urban planning, technology and crafts, language and writing, religion and ideology, as well as the decline of this culture. While up-to-date on latest scholarly perspectives, the textbook also attempts to render the lived experience of this civilization more vivid and meaningful.</p>
<h2>Overview of the Harappan Civilization</h2>
<p>Emerging along the Indus River valley and its tributaries in the 3rd millennium BCE, the Harappan culture dominated the northern half of the Indian subcontinent for over half a millennium. Remarkable for its town planning, standardized weights and measures, impressively large population centers like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, and seemingly peaceful integration of diverse communities, the Harappan civilization was one of the earliest and most influential urban cultures of the Old World. It maintained far-reaching international trade networks procuring materials like lapis lazuli from as far away as Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The cultural legacy of the Harappans continues to permeate South Asian traditions today. Integrating archaeological data with perspectives from art history, comparative mythology and ethics, this textbook aims to do justice to the sophistication of this enigmatic culture.</p>
